This is just a small text file to keep track of my progress with fixing the synthetic data function.

THINGS TO FIX:
    CURRENTLY, BASELINE != 1 DOES NOT WORK
    ADD DOCUMENTATION TO THESE FUNCTIONS!!! (HELPER FUNCTIONS)
    DOES NOT WORK WITH THE as.data.frame(hairEyeColor) DATA SET
    
Replace attrIndex with col
Replace baseline with
Replace baselineVals with

Using the Hubway data and baseline=2...
    (I also need to try with another baseline, because baseline=1 (start station) is so similar to baseline=2 (end station))
    CONFIRMED 2 WORK:
        syntheticData <- data.frame(genIndependentAttribute(data, baseline, dataPrivacyConstant))
        nonBaseAttributes <- setdiff(1:ncol(data), baseline)
    Does NOT Work:
        i = 1: syntheticData[ , i] <- genAttribute(data, baseline, i, syntheticData[1], dataPrivacyConstant)
            genAttribute(data, baseline, i, syntheticData[1], dataPrivacyConstant)
